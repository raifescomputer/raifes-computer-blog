            <h2>Welcome to Raife's Computer</h2>
            <p>My name is Ryanne, and this blog is named in honor of my younger brother, Raife. He was the most intelligent person I’ve ever known, and our dad used to joke that he would one day start a tech company called Raife’s Computer. After he passed, I was given the custom-built computer he created, and it’s now the machine I work on every day. This blog is my way of carrying forward his passion for technology and showcasing my abilities as a Woman in STEM.</p>
