# Raife’s Computer

**Welcome to Raife’s Computer!**  
This blog is a space where I document my journey through computers, AI, coding, and more, as I pursue my degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence.

## 🧠 About

My name is **Ryanne**, and this blog is named in honor of my younger brother, **Raife**, who passed away in 2022. He was the most intelligent person I’ve ever known, and our dad used to joke that he would one day start a tech company called *Raife’s Computer*.

After he passed, I was given the custom-built computer he created, and it’s now the machine I work on every day. This blog is my way of carrying forward his passion for technology and honoring his memory.
