Raife’s Computer
Welcome to Raife’s Computer! This blog is a space where I document my journey in computers, AI, coding, and more as I pursue my degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence.

About
My name is Ryanne, and this blog is named in honor of my younger brother, Raife, who passed away in 2022. He was the most intelligent person I’ve ever known, and our dad used to joke that he would one day start a tech company called Raife’s Computer. After he passed, I was given the custom-built computer he created, and it’s now the machine I work on every day. This blog is my way of carrying forward his passion for technology.
