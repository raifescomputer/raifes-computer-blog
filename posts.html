                <h3>Why I Named My Blog "Raife’s Computer"</h3>
                <p class="post-date">Published: February 25, 2025</p>
                <p>Hi, I’m Ryanne, and this is Raife’s Computer—a blog about computers, AI, coding, and all the things I’m learning as I pursue my degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence. But before we dive into all that, I want to share the story behind the name.</p>
                <p>If you’re wondering, “Who’s Raife?”—he was my younger brother. Ten years younger than me, to be exact. And he was the most intelligent person I’ve ever met. In 2022, I lost him, but his brilliance, curiosity, and passion for technology continue to inspire me every single day.</p>
                <p>Growing up, our dad used to joke that one day Raife would have his own tech company and name it Raife’s Computer. It was just one of those casual family remarks, the kind you laugh at and maybe don’t think too much about at the time. But after he passed, I was given the computer he built from scratch—the same machine I now use every day for my work, studies, and projects.</p>
                <p>It only felt right to name this blog in his honor. Raife’s Computer is a place where I’ll share my journey in tech, showcase my projects, and document everything I’m learning. It’s a tribute to my brother, his passion for technology, and the future he never got to build.</p>
                <p>So, welcome to Raife’s Computer. Whether you’re here for coding, AI, or just to follow along with my journey, I’m glad you’re here.</p>
                <p>Until next time, Ryanne</p>
